Openfire-based XMPP chat server
===============================

These scripts use docker to launch an openfire jabber server locally. You
can install docker if you're running linux, or install boot2docker to run
docker on OSX.

When running on OSX, all of the chat server data is stored in the
openfire-volume container... so if you delete it, you'll lose your server data!
