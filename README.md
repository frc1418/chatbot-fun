Fun with chatbots
=================

Get started by installing the necessary python modules via pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run the bot on the command line (requires a valid login on some chat
server):

    ./bot.py --jid my-bot@mine.local

Advanced fun
------------

You *could* run your bot on a public XMPP server (such as google chat,
jabber.org, etc), but when you're just playing with things it's better to
only play with your own local servers in case you get carried away... 

Find instructions/scripts to run your own local jabber server in the
'server' directory.
